 * IMPORTANT: This file is currently not being used as the main server entry point.
 * 
 * We recommend using server.js instead to avoid confusion and potential port conflicts.
 * Consider either:
 * 1. Removing this file
 * 2. Renaming it to something like "app.config.js" and using it only for configuration
 * 3. Consolidating the unique functionality from this file into server.js
 * 
 * The application now runs on port 5001 via the server.js file.
