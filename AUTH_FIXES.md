# Authentication Issues Resolution

## Problems Fixed

1. **API Base URL Standardization**
   - Changed direct axios calls to use the unified api.js utility
   - Updated frontend API endpoint URLs to use port 5001 consistently
   - Added improved error handling in API requests

2. **MongoDB Case Sensitivity Issue**
   - Fixed the database name from "scanai" to "scanAi" to match existing database
   - Updated all MongoDB connection strings for consistency

3. **Port Conflicts Resolution**
   - Changed server port from 5000 to 5001 in server.js
   - Updated .env file to reflect the new port settings
   - Resolved conflicts between multiple server files

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added detailed error logging in auth.js
   - Improved token validation error messages
   - Added global error handler middleware

5. **Authentication Flow**
   - Fixed token management in AuthContext.jsx
   - Added better debugging for login/registration process
   - Ensured proper CORS configuration for credentials

## Testing Confirmation

The following operations now work successfully:
- User registration (POST `/api/auth/signup`)
- User login (POST `/api/auth/login`)
- Authentication token validation
- Protected route access

## Additional Updates (Latest)

1. **CORS Configuration Fix**
   - Updated CORS settings in both app.js and server.js to allow the correct frontend origin (http://localhost:5173)
   - Previous setting was incorrectly allowing only http://localhost:3000

2. **Frontend Configuration Fix**
   - Fixed a typo in vite.config.js (changed ' ecure' to 'secure')
   - Ensured consistent port usage across all configuration files

3. **Port Standardization**
   - Updated app.js to use the same PORT from environment variables (5001)
   - Eliminated port number hardcoding to use environment configs consistently

## Server Consolidation (Latest)

1. **Server Entry Point Standardization**
   - Made server.js the official main entry point
   - Updated package.json to reference server.js instead of app.js
   - Created start-server.ps1 script for easy server startup
   - Backed up app.js as app.js.backup2 for reference

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Added more detailed comments in server.js
   - Created clear startup instructions
   - Added troubleshooting section for common issues

## Next Steps

1. Ensure all frontend components use the updated API port (5001) consistently
2. Consider enhancing frontend error display for better user experience
3. Run a comprehensive test of all authentication-dependent features
4. Consider deprecating app.js completely after ensuring server.js has all needed functionality
