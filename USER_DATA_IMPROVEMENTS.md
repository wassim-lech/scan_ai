# User Registration and Profile System Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Data Validation

#### Backend
- Added validation for `phone` field in the User model with regex pattern
- Added validation for `address` field in the User model with max length constraint
- Added address length validation in the profile update route
- Improved error messages for validation failures

#### Frontend
- Added address validation in the registration form
- Enhanced validation in the profile update form (phone format and address length)
- Added clearer error messages for form fields

### 2. Improved Logging

- Enhanced profile update logging to show exactly which fields are being changed
- Added better logging format for debugging user data flows
- Added clear distinction between changed and unchanged fields in logs

### 3. Testing

- Created a test script (`scripts/test-user-data.js`) to verify that all user fields are correctly:
  - Saved during user registration
  - Retrieved when accessing user data
  - Updated when editing profile information
- The script creates a test user, verifies all fields, updates the user, verifies again, and then cleans up

## How to Test

1. Run the provided test script:
   ```
   cd backend
   ./test-user-data.ps1
   ```

2. Manual Testing:
   - Register a new user with all fields filled in
   - Check the database to verify all fields are saved
   - Update the user profile and check that changes are persisted
   - Test validation by entering invalid data

## Fields Verified
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Phone
- Address
- Username

All fields now have proper validation, error handling, and persistence in the database.
